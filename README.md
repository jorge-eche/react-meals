## Overview

### The project

Users should be able to:

- Add one or more meals to the cart.
- Remove from the cart an individual item or the whole meal.
- See the updated total amount (price) of the order.
- Receive a confirmation 'Thank you' message after order is finalized.
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and animated states for interactive elements.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - React environment
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - For Styles
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - Frontend language
- [Semantic HTML5 markup](https://www.w3.org/html/) - For the web structure

### What I learned

- This project was very important for cementing key React hooks and tools: Context API, useReducer, Portals and useRef. I've learned and understood the difference between them, the use cases, the do's and do not's, etc.
- Not least important, I got to review the React basics I already knew: useState, useEffect hooks, conditional rendering of lists, styling React components, forms, Fragments, managing side effects, among others.
- Lastly, thanks to this project I came to appreciate the beauty and usefulness of CSS Modules, which permits us to separate CSS files component-wise while at the same time saving us from the hassle of coordinating and figuring out different class / id names so styles do not get overwritten by other more specific ones.

### If I had more time I would change this

- Even though the main goal of the app was to practice more comple State management with Context and Reducer, if I had more time I would like to add a more sophisticated logic behind the 'Order' meal button, so that something fancier than a 'Thank You' message happens after the user order their meals.

### Continued development

- I've already finished a Jest and React Testing Library course, so I decided to embark on an thorough React course, which is the third course on React I do. After I finish with React I will go for TypeScript.
